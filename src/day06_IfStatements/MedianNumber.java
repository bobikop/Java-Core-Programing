/*
1. Create a class named MedianNumber. write a program that can find the median number between three DIFFERENT given integers

		Ex:
                a = 10, b= 15, c = 20;

            Output:
                15 is the median number


2. Create a  class named NumberToWord, and write a java program that can convert numbers between 0 ~ 9 to words
			Ex:
				number = 1;

			output:
				One

		Note: Do not use more than one print statement


3. Create a class called Calculator, Given two double variables named n1 & n2, and a char variable named mathOperator, write a program that can calculate result of n1&n2 based on the given math Operator.

		char operator -> -, +, *, /

		when operator is + : add num1, num2
		when operator: - : minus num1, num2
		when operator: * : multiply num1, num2
		when operator: / : divide num1, num2
		for any other operators: print "invalid operator"

		Ex:
			n1 = 10, n2= 20, mathOperator = '+'

		output:
			30

4. Creata a class named ChooseLanguage, Given an integer variable named selection that has a number between 1~5, Write a program that can select the language based on the number that's given in selection and prints the following message:

		for 1: Hello, thank for your call
		for 2: Hola, gracias para llamar
		for 3: Merhaba, aradiginiz icin tesekkurler
		for 4: Privet, spasibo za vash zvonok
		for 5: Merci ,pour votre appel

	Note: Do not use more than one print statement


5. Create a class named CharacterIdentity, and write a program that can identify if the given character is a digit or Alphabetic Character(A~Z or a~Z) or a special character

		Ex:
			ch = '@'

		output:
			Special Character


			ch = '1'

		output:
			digit
